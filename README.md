# Python Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms

There are some amazing Machine learning libraries written in Python (example [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)). These
libraries make it a cinch to fit ML models to training datasets.

From my experience using sklearn to build ML models at [Teva UK](http://tevauk.com), I noticed that I barely understood how the learning algorithms I was using worked; these libraries make you lazy 🙈. I decided to fill the gaps in my knowledge by getting dirty with the algorithms, learning how they actually work 💪.

This repo will contain my implementations of popular learning algorithms. Please feel free to make contributions 🙏.
